			"rating": 5,
			"notes": "Nostalgic movie, especially for anyone that grew up in the 70's and/or went to boarding school. Themes include the divide between people who are privileged and not, and those who are ostracized or revered. Lots of character growth. Great story, great acting. Also touches upon mental illness and grieving the loss of a loved one.",
